# Day-To-Day-Equities
Ever wanted to know how the stock market performed the day before/of/after earnings? 

Would you like to know how the market reacts whenever FOMC meets?

This is the tool for you! and well... me, some knowledge of just how panic/greed/etc may play out given a specific thesis.


## Why did I make this?
To my knowledge, there does not exist a tool that looks up the shape of price-action tools on specific equities given a given interval.
